# Project 3: Spots

- Shane Mufarinya

- This project is an screen adaptable website that simplifies the method of sharing photos online.

- In this project I used responisve design, media queries to to adjust the size of elements based on ones screen size. I also took advantage of grid-layout to style the pictures in a consistent and cohesive way. All code is completed in accordance with BEM metholodogy.

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**  
  
* [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)
  
**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
